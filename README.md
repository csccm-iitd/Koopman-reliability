# 'Koopman operator for time-dependent reliabilty analysis
The repository providespython codes for the numerical examples illustrated in the paper ‘Koopman operator for time-dependent reliabilty analysis’
Please go through the paper to understand the implemented algorithm.
Requirements:

1. Install python package pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.

2. First two numerical examples are given separately in folders for the two different cases and named as
   ‘Duffing_var_ics’,‘Duffing_var_parameters’ and ‘Lorenz_ics’,‘Lorenz_var_parameters’.

3. Add the data path use the run file to execute.
