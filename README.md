'Koopman operator for time-dependent reliabilty analysis'
The repository providespython codes for the numerical examples illustrated in the paper ‘Koopman operator for time-dependent reliabilty analysis’
Please go through the paper to understand the implemented algorithm.
Requirements:

1. Install python package pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.

2. Four numerical examples are given separately in folders and named as
   ‘Duffing_var_ics’, ‘Duffing_var_ics’,’ Example3_Truss’ and ‘Example4_Sixstorey_building.

3. Add the ‘H-PCFE_p’ folder to numerical example folders to run.
